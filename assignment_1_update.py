    # ingredients: A list of strings representing the ingredients. check

    # View All Dish Names:

    # Allow the user to input a dish name.

    # Filter Dishes by Calorie Count: check

    # Provide two separate options to:
    # View all dishes below a certain calorie threshold.
    # View all dishes above a certain calorie threshold.
    # Display the name, calorie count, and ingredients for all matching dishes. check
    # Add a New Dish:

    # Allow the user to input a new dish, including its name, calorie count, and ingredients (as a comma-separated list).
    # Add the new dish to the inventory.
    # Ensure that dish names are unique. If a dish with the same name already exists, prompt the user to enter a different name.
    # Remove a Dish by Name: check

    # Allow the user to specify the name of a dish to remove.
    # If the dish exists, remove it from the inventory.
    # If the dish does not exist, display an appropriate error message. check
    # Modify a Dish by Name:

    # Allow the user to specify a dish name to modify.
    # If the dish exists, present options to:
    # Change the dishâ€™s name. check
    # Update its calorie count. check
    # Add new ingredients to the list. check
    # Remove specific ingredients from the list. check

    # Search Dishes by Ingredient:

    # Allow the user to search for dishes containing a specific ingredient.
    # Display the names of all dishes that include the specified ingredient.
